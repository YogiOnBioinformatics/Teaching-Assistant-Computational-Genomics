**Highlights** 

► Selected as sole UTA to facilitate teaching of Genome Browsers, Unix, Genome arithmetic, Sequence Alignment, ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq to 40 students. 
► Surpassed expectation of accessibility by giving students personal phone number to text on-demand as issues arose. 
► Planned and delivered 3 workshops ranging from Computational Genomics tools to Molecular Biology/Mathematics for Bioinformatics. 
► Earned 100% helpfulness rating in Teaching Assistant Performance Review.
